## Hello There

I'm Khalil, a software engineer focusing on backend, <br>
I have been working on a payment gateway company for last 5 years

I'm more of a product engineer, even though I prefer to dive into the payment system, I would love to work on anything related to backend, infrastructure, automation, customer dashboard, system statistics and visualization, or increasing developer experience at any level.
